#### By Avi Cohen

## Technologies Used

## Description

The main purpose of this project was to create the logic of an autocomplete algorithm. I had to face performance issues such as re-renders and network requests. I believe the solution I wrote (inspired by Stephen Grider), is a great combination of efficiency and performance and I am happy to share my optimized way of doing it.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* npm i 
* npm run init-client
